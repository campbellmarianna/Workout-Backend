# Workout App Proposal
This is a mobile app that will be modeled after the program StringLifts. The functionality of this app will keep track of your workout and the history of your workouts.

**Due Date:** Friday, July 5

## Schedule

A **daily outline** to assist in planning my sprint:

* **Thursday, 20**: Write API tests.

* **Sunday 23**: Implement API.
* **Monday 24**: Implement API.

### Project Notes:
- Rep (repetition) is one complete motion of an exercise
- A set is a group of consecutive repetitions
- For example, you can say, "I did two sets of ten reps on the chest press."
- One can create a (instance of a) workout for each day
